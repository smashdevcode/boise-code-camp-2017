# Presentation (Cut)

### Migration Flow Review

* JS project
* Add JSDoc comments
* Added tsconfig.json to support down-compile to ES5
* Incrementally convert files to TS
* Add d.ts files where necessary to provide typing information for JS files

### Build Tools

TS plays with build tools like npm, gulp, grunt, and webpack.

### Take It Easy

* Nominate TS free zones
* Offer an escape hatch (throw out the TS and commit the generated JS to source control again)
